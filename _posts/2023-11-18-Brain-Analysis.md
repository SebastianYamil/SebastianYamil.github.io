## Quantitative EEG Analysis

**Diagnosis:** Migraine, possible language disorder.  
**Age:** 49 years.  
**Handedness:** Right.  
**Date of Recording:** 03-03-16.  
**Recording System:** International 10-20 in Faraday Chamber. Filter: 1.6-40 Hz, 60Hz window.

Below is the average Power Spectrum (PA) of 3 samples each lasting 12s. In the lateral derivations (histogram to the left), a decrease in the total power spectrum is observed in the T5O1 derivation. The topographic distribution of alpha shows gradual increases from anterior to posterior regions (fronto-occipital gradient) in the right hemisphere, but not in the left, as alpha reaches its highest power in T3T5, while it is much lower in T5O1. Also, there is a 60% asymmetry of alpha in temporo-occipital (TO). Beta PA is higher in fronto-frontal (FF), decreases in fronto-temporal (FT), temporo-temporal (TT), and is asymmetric in TO (44%). Delta presents a “U” shaped profile with higher PA in FF, decreases in FT, decreases again in TT, and slightly increases in TO of AH. Theta is higher in FF, decreases in FT, increases in TT, and decreases again in TO of AH.

**Interpretation:** The asymmetry of alpha and beta in temporo-occipital regions has been related to paroxysmal hemicranial headache.

### Eyes Closed/Open

In the condition with eyes closed, there is lower power of the four frequencies in the left hemisphere (HI) compared to the right side. The asymmetry in the temporo-occipital derivations is noteworthy. Eyelid opening produces a decrease in PA (desynchronization) of alpha in both hemispheres (AH), while beta increases (synchronization) in the left FF, remains unchanged in the right FF, and desynchronizes in the rest of the derivations. Delta desynchronizes in FF of AH and right FT, and in all other derivations it decreases very slightly. Theta slightly desynchronizes in all lateral derivations.

**Interpretation:** The asymmetry of the power spectrum, particularly of the alpha rhythm, is confirmed and the absence of the increase of beta in the posterior derivations upon eye opening is observed. Additionally, there is an attenuated response to eyelid opening in the slow frequencies (delta and theta). All of which suggests a subtle alteration of the activating systems of the brainstem.

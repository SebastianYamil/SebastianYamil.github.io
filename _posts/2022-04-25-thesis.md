This thesis, co-authored with my colleague Samantha Menchaca, delves into the vital role of access to credit and other financial services for individuals. We explore how these services not only facilitate essential financial transactions but also empower people by providing them with the tools necessary for financial stability and growth.

The core of our research focuses on understanding the various aspects of financial services, particularly credit, and how they influence the everyday lives of individuals. By examining different case studies and statistical data, we highlight the significant impact that access to financial services has on personal finance management, investment opportunities, and overall economic well-being.

This comprehensive study aims to shed light on the importance of these services and proposes recommendations for improving access to them, thereby contributing to more inclusive financial systems.
